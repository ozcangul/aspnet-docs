# Custom formatters in ASP.NET Core MVC web APIs

By [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra)

ASP.NET Core MVC has built-in support for formatting response data in JSON, XML, or plain text formats. This article shows how to add support for additional formats by creating and using custom formatters.

The process for adding custom format support is straightforward:

* Create an output formatter class to format data sent to the client.
* Create an input formatter class to format data received from the client. 
* Add instances of the formatter classes to the InputFormatters and OutputFormatters collections in MVCOptions.

[View or download sample from GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/mvc/advanced/custom-formatters/sample).

## When to use custom formatters

Use custom formatters when you want the [content negotiation](xref:mvc/models/formatting) process to support a content type that isn't supported by the built-in formatters (JSON, XML, and plain text).

For example, Google Protobuf is a binary format that is more efficient than text types. vCard is a text format commonly used for exchanging contact data. The sample app implements a simple vCard formatter.

## How to create a custom formatter class

To create a formatter:
* Derive the class from the appropriate base class
* Specify valid media types and encodings in the constructor
* Override CanReadType/CanWriteType methods
* Override ReadRequestBodyAsync/WriteResponseBodyAsync methods
  
### Derive from the appropriate base class

For text media types (for example, vCard), derive from the TextInputFormatter or TextOutputFormatter base class.  Otherwise, derive from the InputFormatter or OutputFormatter base class.

### Specify valid media types and encodings

In the constructor, specify valid media types and encodings by adding to the SupportedMediaTypes and SupportedEncodings collections.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't do constructor dependency injection in a formatter class.  For example, you can't get a logger by adding a logger parameter to the constructor parameters.  To access services, you have to use the context object that gets passed in to your methods.

### Override CanReadType/CanWriteType 

To specify the type you can deserialize into or serialize from override the CanReadType or CanWriteType methods.  For example, you might only be able to create vCard text from a Contact type and vice versa.

For output formatters, 
    * Note about output formatters:  use CanWriteType for design time type, use CanWriteResult for runtime type

### Override ReadRequestBodyAsync/WriteResponseBodyAsync 

to do the actual work of deserializing/serializing

## Content Negotiation

Content negotiation (*conneg* for short) occurs when the client specifies an [Accept header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The default format used by ASP.NET Core MVC is JSON. Content negotiation is implemented by `ObjectResult`. It is also built into the status code specific action results returned from the helper methods (which are all based on `ObjectResult`). You can also return a model type (a class you've defined as your data transfer type) and the framework will automatically wrap it in an `ObjectResult` for you.

The following action method uses the `Ok` and `NotFound` helper methods:

[!code-csharp[Main](./formatting/sample/src/ResponseFormattingSample/Controllers/Api/AuthorsController.cs?highlight=8,10&range=28-38)]

A JSON-formatted response will be returned unless another format was requested and the server can return the requested format. You can use a tool like [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) to create a request that includes an Accept header and specify another format. In that case, if the server has a *formatter* that can produce a response in the requested format, the result will be returned in the client-preferred format.

![Fiddler console showing a manually-created GET request with an Accept header value of application/xml](formatting/_static/fiddler-composer.png)

In the above screenshot, the Fiddler Composer has been used to generate a request, specifying `Accept: application/xml`. By default, ASP.NET Core MVC only supports JSON, so even when another format is specified, the result returned is still JSON-formatted. You'll see how to add additional formatters in the next section.

Controller actions can return POCOs (Plain Old CLR Objects), in which case ASP.NET MVC will automatically create an `ObjectResult` for you that wraps the object. The client will get the formatted serialized object (JSON format is the default; you can configure XML or other formats). If the object being returned is `null`, then the framework will return a `204 No Content` response.

Returning an object type:

[!code-csharp[Main](./formatting/sample/src/ResponseFormattingSample/Controllers/Api/AuthorsController.cs?highlight=3&range=40-45)]

In the sample, a request for a valid author alias will receive a 200 OK response with the author's data. A request for an invalid alias will receive a 204 No Content response. Screenshots showing the response in XML and JSON formats are shown below.

### Content Negotiation Process

Content *negotiation* only takes place if an `Accept` header appears in the request. When a request contains an accept header, the framework will enumerate the media types in the accept header in preference order and will try to find a formatter that can produce a response in one of the formats specified by the accept header. In case no formatter is found that can satisfy the client's request, the framework will try to find the first formatter that can produce a response (unless the developer has configured the option on `MvcOptions` to return 406 Not Acceptable instead). If the request specifies XML, but the XML formatter has not been configured, then the JSON formatter will be used. More generally, if no formatter is configured that can provide the requested format, then the first formatter than can format the object is used. If no header is given, the first formatter that can handle the object to be returned will be used to serialize the response. In this case, there isn't any
negotiation taking place - the server is determining what format it will use.

> [!NOTE]
> If the Accept header contains `*/*`, the Header will be ignored unless `RespectBrowserAcceptHeader` is set to true on `MvcOptions`.

### Browsers and Content Negotiation

Unlike typical API clients, web browsers tend to supply `Accept` headers that include a wide array of formats, including wildcards. By default, when the framework detects that the request is coming from a browser, it will ignore the `Accept` header and instead return the content in the application's configured default format (JSON unless otherwise configured). This provides a more consistent experience when using different browsers to consume APIs.

If you would prefer your application honor browser accept headers, you can configure this as part of MVC's configuration by setting `RespectBrowserAcceptHeader` to `true` in the `ConfigureServices` method in *Startup.cs*.

```csharp
services.AddMvc(options =>
{
  options.RespectBrowserAcceptHeader = true; // false by default
}
```

## Configuring Formatters

If your application needs to support additional formats beyond the default of JSON, you can add NuGet packages and configure MVC to support them. There are separate formatters for input and output. Input formatters are used by [Model Binding](model-binding.md); output formatters are used to format responses. You can also configure [ðŸ”§ Custom Formatters](../advanced/custom-formatters.md).

### Adding XML Format Support

To add support for XML formatting, install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Formatters.Xml` NuGet package.

Add the XmlSerializerFormatters to MVC's configuration in *Startup.cs*:

[!code-csharp[Main](./formatting/sample/src/ResponseFormattingSample/Startup.cs?highlight=4&range=30-36)]

Alternately, you can add just the output formatter:

```csharp
services.AddMvc(options =>
{
  options.OutputFormatters.Add(new XmlSerializerOutputFormatter());
});
```

These two approaches will serialize results using `System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer`. If you prefer, you can use the `System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer` by adding its associated formatter:

```csharp
services.AddMvc(options =>
{
  options.OutputFormatters.Add(new XmlDataContractSerializerOutputFormatter());
});
```

Once you've added support for XML formatting, your controller methods should return the appropriate format based on the request's `Accept` header, as this Fiddler example demonstrates:

![Fiddler console: The Raw tab for the request shows the Accept header value is application/xml. The Raw tab for the response shows the Content-Type header value of application/xml.](formatting/_static/xml-response.png)

You can see in the Inspectors tab that the Raw GET request was made with an `Accept: application/xml` header set. The response pane shows the `Content-Type: application/xml` header, and the `Author` object has been serialized to XML.

Use the Composer tab to modify the request to specify `application/json` in the `Accept` header. Execute the request, and the response will be formatted as JSON:

![Fiddler console: The Raw tab for the request shows the Accept header value is application/json. The Raw tab for the response shows the Content-Type header value of application/json.](formatting/_static/json-response-fiddler.png)

In this screenshot, you can see the request sets a header of `Accept: application/json` and the response specifies the same as its `Content-Type`. The `Author` object is shown in the body of the response, in JSON format.

### Forcing a Particular Format

If you would like to restrict the response formats for a specific action you can, you can apply the `[Produces]` filter. The `[Produces]` filter specifies the response formats for a specific action (or controller). Like most [Filters](../controllers/filters.md), this can be applied at the action, controller, or global scope.

```csharp
[Produces("application/json")]
public class AuthorsController
```

The `[Produces]` filter will force all actions within the `AuthorsController` to return JSON-formatted responses, even if other formatters were configured for the application and the client provided an `Accept` header requesting a different, available format. See [Filters](../controllers/filters.md) to learn more, including how to apply filters globally.

### Special Case Formatters

Some special cases are implemented using built-in formatters. By default, `string` return types will be formatted as *text/plain* (*text/html* if requested via `Accept` header). This behavior can be removed by removing the `TextOutputFormatter`. You remove formatters in the `Configure` method in *Startup.cs* (shown below). Actions that have a model object return type will return a 204 No Content response when returning `null`. This behavior can be removed by removing the `HttpNoContentOutputFormatter`. The following code removes the `TextOutputFormatter` and `HttpNoContentOutputFormatter`.

```csharp
services.AddMvc(options =>
{
  options.OutputFormatters.RemoveType<TextOutputFormatter>();
  options.OutputFormatters.RemoveType<HttpNoContentOutputFormatter>();
});
```

Without the `TextOutputFormatter`, `string` return types return 406 Not Acceptable, for example. Note that if an XML formatter exists, it will format `string` return types if the `TextOutputFormatter` is removed.

Without the `HttpNoContentOutputFormatter`, null objects are formatted using the configured formatter. For example, the JSON formatter will simply return a response with a body of `null`, while the XML formatter will return an empty XML element with the attribute `xsi:nil="true"` set.

## Response Format URL Mappings

Clients can request a particular format as part of the URL, such as in the query string or part of the path, or by using a format-specific file extension such as .xml or .json. The mapping from request path should be specified in the route the API is using. For example:

```csharp
[FormatFilter]
public class ProductsController
{
  [Route("[controller]/[action]/{id}.{format?}")]
  public Product GetById(int id)
```

This route would allow the requested format to be specified as an optional file extension. The `[FormatFilter]` attribute checks for the existence of the format value in the `RouteData` and will map the response format to the appropriate formatter when the response is created.

|Route|Formatter|
|--- |--- |
|`/products/GetById/5`|The default output formatter|
|`/products/GetById/5.json`|The JSON formatter (if configured)|
|`/products/GetById/5.xml`|The XML formatter (if configured)|
